# CUFS - Closed Unit Federation system
CUFS Is a concept of Semi-Decentralization service and data management based on no-trust, For each service like authentification is closed on an own centralized system named Unit and no share any data without authorization, even Developer. Example if I have an App. And I want to connect to my account, you need to call Authentification Unit to get specific data, my App. Cannot get data without authorization, even if is in the same project. For developing an Unit, each keys / certificates are given and controlled by unit system, and for production env. each keys / certificates are randomized and rotate automatically and inaccessible without authorization from unit.
